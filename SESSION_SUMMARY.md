# Branching Survey Enhancement Session

**Date:** 2025-06-12

This document summarizes the changes and decisions made during our interactive development session to enhance the branching survey feature.

## 1. Prisma Unique-ID Error Fix
- Replaced bulk `createMany` calls with individual `create` calls to let Prisma generate unique node IDs.
- Introduced an `idMap` to link the client-provided node IDs to the database-assigned IDs for edge creation.
- Updated `getEntryNode` to find the node with no incoming edges, instead of hard-coding `id === 'entry'.`

## 2. Edge Field Alignment (API â‡„ Client)
- Changed the front-end `BranchEdge` type to use `sourceNodeId`/`targetNodeId`.
- Updated the ReactFlow edge-mapping to source these new keys, fixing missing-edge rendering.
- Normalized stub and AI responses in `generateBranchingSurvey` so edges always have `sourceNodeId`/`targetNodeId`, then persisted correctly in the service.

## 3. Prompt and Model Enhancements
- Upgraded the Claude model to `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` for higher capacity.
- Increased `max_tokens` to `16000` and timeout to `20000ms` in `generateBranchingSurvey`.
- Revised the prompt schema to drop rationale generation (rationale will be handled separately in a future phase) and to reference `sourceNodeId`/`targetNodeId` for edges.

## 4. ReactFlow UI Improvements
- Conditionally render `<MiniMap>` only when the node count exceeds a threshold (`nodes.length > 8`).
- Adjusted the grid-based layout logic so nodes still flow vertically but can be extended to a grid in the future (grid layout sketched).
- Ensured the top-level graph container uses a flex layout to accommodate a future chat-sidebar overlay.

## 5. Next Steps (Planned)
1. **Rationale Generation**: Implement a separate routine/modal for generating and displaying question rationales.  
2. **Chat Overlay**: Add the `<ChatOverlay>` component in a sidebar flex panel.  
3. **Methodology Embedding**: Fine-tune the AI prompt further and validate the JSON schema with real Claude calls.  
4. **E2E Testing**: Add tests for the branching survey flow (student & teacher sides).  
5. **Styling Polish**: Update CSS modules or theme variables as needed for grid, buttons, and modals.
